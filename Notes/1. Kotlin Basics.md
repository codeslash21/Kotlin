# Kotlin Basics
- [Variables](#variables)
- [Operators](#operators)
- [Type Casting](#type-casting)

## Variables
There are two types of variable - `changeable` ad `non-changeable`. Variable declared with `val` is non-changeable and variable declared with `var` is changeable. We cant change the variable type later.
```
val fish1 = 2 // non-changeable
var fish2 = 3 // changeable
fish1 = "Fish" // will give error
fish2 = "Fish" // will work
```
`val` is an immutable reference which does not say anything about the content that is stored. We can modify the content using modification method, but we cant modify the reference.
```
val arr = mutableListOf("value1")
arr.add("value2")
```

## Operators
```
val fish=2
# below operations will result the same
fish+2 | fish.plus(2)
fish-1 | fish.minus(1)
fish*2 | fish.times(2)
fish/2 | fish.div(2)
```

## Type Casting
- We can set the variable type explicitly by using `:` and the type name after that. For example `val i:Int = 1`
- We cant assign one type of variable to another type of variable. Implicit type casting in Kotlin is not allowed. We can do that explicitly.
```
val b:Byte = 1
val i:Int = b // this will give error as we cant store Byte to an Int type variable

val i:Int = b.toInt() // this will work, as we are explicitly changin the type of b while assigning
```
- When we give variable type explicitly, by default its value cant be `null`.
```
val i:Int = null // this will give error
val i:Int? = null // this will work, this means the variable can be null
```
For complex data structure like list, we can tell that list element can be null, or list can be null or both can be null
```
var l:List<String?> = listOf(null) // list element can be null, l = listOf(null, null)
varl:List<String>? = null // list can be null
var l:List<String?>? = null // list or list element both can be null
```
- Elvis operator (`?:`) is kind of ternary operator in other language
```
val fish = 5
return fish?.dec() ?: 0 // if fish is not null then fish value will be decremented by 1 and that value will be returned, otherwise 0 will be returned
```
