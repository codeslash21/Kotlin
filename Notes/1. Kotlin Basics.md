# Kotlin Basics
## Variables
There are two types of variable - `changeable` ad `non-changeable`. Variable declared with `val` is non-changeable and variable declared with `var` is changeable. We cant change the variable type later.
```
val fish = 2 // non-changeable
var fish = 3 // changeable
fish = "Fish" // will give error
```

## Operators
```
val fish=2
# below operations will result the same
fish+2 | fish.plus(2)
fish-1 | fish.minus(1)
fish*2 | fish.times(2)
fish/2 | fish.div(2)
