## If Else
`if` is an expression in kotlin, means it returns a value that can be assigned to a variable. 

## When Statement
- `when` statement in Kotlin works like `switch` case in other language.
```
fun food(day:String) : String {
   var food = "fasting"
      when(day) {
        "Monday" -> food = "rice"
        "Tuesday" -> food = "chicken"
        else -> food = "egg"
      }
  return food
}
```
- Here we dont have to give `break` statement, it will automatically break when a particular condition will be satisfied. In kotlin everything has some value, so we can directly return the value of `when` statement without storing the value to a variable. For example,
```
return when(day) {
    "Monday" -> "rice"
    "Tuesday" -> "checken"
    else -> "egg"
}
```
- We can write `when` statement without passing argument to it. `when` statement without argument works as sequence of if-else statements. When we dont pass any arguments, then we can use any boolean expression as branch condition. For example,
```
return when {
    temp > 30 -> true
    color == "red" -> true
    else -> false
}
```

- Using `when` we can check if the argument is equal to one of the values separated by `,`. For example
```
when(input) {
  "y", "Y" -> "Yes"
  "n", "N" -> "NO"
  else -> "Other"
}
```
- We can use any expression as branch condition. For example, we can use `set` also, in that case order of the elements will not be mattered.

- We can use `when` for checking object types. For example,

## For Loop
- `for` loop is little different than that in Java. Iterating over list or map using `for` loop is as follows

- Iterating over a range using `for` loop

- Iterating over a string

## In Operator
- `in` can be used for two cases `iteration` and to check `belonging`. For example,

## Exception
- In Kotlin, there is no checked exception.
- `throw` is an expression, we can assign the value of it to a variable.

- `try` is also an expression in kotlin, we can assign the value of `try` to a variable.
