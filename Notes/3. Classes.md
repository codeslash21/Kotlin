# Classes

## Access Modifier
- **`Public`** By default all the class and the class members are public. Those are accessable from anywhere.
- **`Private`** Class and class member are accessable within the class. Subclass cant access these.
- **`Protected`** Class and class members are accessable within the class and subclass also can access these.
- **`Interanl`** Class and class members are accessable within the module, means we can access from anywhere inside our project. Module is set of kotlin files which are compiled together. But if we compile our library it would not exported (as class or funtion).

## Class Construtor
We can have more than one class constructor.

Here `this()` refers to the default construtor. If we declare a parameter of a class with `val` or `var` then it will create a class variable and we can access to variable using `.` operator. And, if the parameter does not have `val` or `var` then we cant access that variable using class instance. Using this technique we dont need to create multiple construtor for different commbination of parameters.

Class can have multiple `init` blocks, which works like construtor. `inti` block will be executed before secondary constructor from top to bottom. If `init` block uses any variable that need to be declared before the `init` block. If any class parameters dont have `val` or `var` then those are called default parameters and we can use default parameters for optional values instead of creating multile constructor. When we call default constructor using `this` then we have to give the values for all required parameter which does not have any default values.

## Inheritance
If we want to inherit from a class then we have to make that class open using `open` before the class. To inherit frm parent class we have to use `:` after the child-class and then parent-class after the `:`. But, by default the parent-class members are not accessable from the derived class. To access any parent-class member we need to make that member as open. And, if we want to override any variable or methods then we have to use `override` keywords.

## Interface
We can create an abstract class using `abstract` keyword and to create an interface we have to use `interface` keyword. The difference between abstract class and interface is that abstract class can have constructor but interface cant have.

Interface delegation let's you add features to a class via composition. Composition is when you use an instance of another class as opposed to inheriting from it.

Here `GoldColor` is an object of `FishColor` and we cant create any more `GoldColor` object of `FishColor`. In Kotlin we can create singleton object like this. `FishCOlor by GoldColor` means implement the `FishColor` interface by deferring all calls to the object `GoldColor`. 

## Data Class
In Kotlin, the class that mostly holds data is called data class. We can declare data class by by prefixing class declaration with `data`. With data class, printing the object prints the vaue of properties, instead the address of the object. That with the help of `object pointer`. Basically, it creates `toString` for us to print the properties. Data class also provides `equals` method to compare two instances of a data class.

If values of all properties are same for the two objects of a data class then `equals` method will return `true`. For above example, `d3.equals(d2)` will return `true`. Using `copy` method we can create an instance of data class with the same properties values. 

To get the object properties and assign them to variables Kotlin uses a process called `decomposition`. While, decomposition the number of variables should be exactly same as the number of properties in the object.

## Special Classes
- `Singleton` class is a class which will have only one instance at any given point of time. We can declare a class `Singleton` by using `object` instead of `class`.
- `enum` actually defines a class and you can give them properties or event methods. You can declare enum by modifying the class keyword with `enum`. Like `singleton` class `enum` will create exactly one object of each class.
- `sealed` class can be subclassed but only inside the file where its declared. As class and subclass are in the same file compiler knows all the class statically, means compile time.

## NOTE:
- Class properties get initialised in the order in which they are defined.
