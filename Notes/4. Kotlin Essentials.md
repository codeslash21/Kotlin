# Kotlin Essentials
## Pair
`Pair` is a Kotlin datatype that allows us to create a generic pair of values. We can create a pair in the following way

## Constants
- `val` and `const val` both variable can be initialised only once. But, there is one difference. Value of the variable declared with `const val` si determined during the compile time where as the value of variable declared with `val` will be determined during the execution time. So, we cant assign the return value of a function to a variable declared with `const val` as we will know the return value of the function during execution time. `const val` will work at top level means outside of any class or inside the class declared with `object` instead of regular class declared with `class`. Kotlin does not have class level constant. To define constants inside a class you have wrap them into `companion object`. The difference between `companion object` and regular `object` is that `companion object` is initialised from the static constructor of the containing class, that they are created when object is created. Regular `object` is created lazily on the first access to that object.

## Extension function
Kotlin provides method called `extension function` to add extra functionality to the existing class. Once, you declare an extension function, its available as if it was declared on the class. By defining extension you dont insert new member into the class, we merely make a new function callable with `.` notation on the variable of the type of the class.

Within the extension function `this` bound to the instance it's called on. Extension function does not have access to the private member of the class. They can only use the public api. Extension functions are always resolved statically (means at compile time) based on the variable they are applied to. 

Just like extension function we can have `extension property`. After the `.` operator we will have the property name. For example,
