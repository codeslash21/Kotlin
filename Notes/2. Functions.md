# Functions

- [Main](#main)
- [Types of Function](#types-of-function)
- [Import Function](#import-function)

## Main
- `main` function is the entry point of the kotlin program. It takes array of strings as argument
```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, world!")
    println("Hello, ${args[0]}")
}
```
- By default `main` function and `println` return value of type `Unit`, if the return type is not mentioned explicitly. `Unit` is kind of `void` in other language. For example `val v = println("Hello")`, here v is of type `kotlin.Unit`
- We can put an expression within string template `$`. Even we can put `if-else` statement also within string template.
- We can give the return type of the function. `fun name(first:String) : String {}`, here, function `name` takes an argument of type `String` and return value of type `String`. But, giving return type is not mandatory.
- Within function body if there is only one statement and that is also return statement, then we can use function expression like below
```
fun max(a:Int, b:Int):Int {
    return if(a>b) a else b
}

fun max(a:Int, b:Int) = if(a>b) a else b
```

## Types of Function
There are three types o function.
- Top-level function, not enclosed within a class or another function
```
fun topLevel() = 1
```
- Member function, function within a class
```
class A {
    fun member() = 2
}
```
- Local function, function within another function
```
fun other() {
    fun local() = 3
}
```

## Import Function
If we want to import a function from another package lets say `A` and that function is written in the file `FunA`, then we have to use
```
import A.FunA
FunA.A()

OR

import A.FunA.*
A()
```
If you want you can change the name of the class that contains all the top-level functions as 'static' functions. For that, you use a '@JVMName' annotation. You annotate the file contents and put the annotation right before the package name.

- We can use java library within Kotlin code.
- We can give default value to function argument. For example, `fun name(arg:String = "value") {}`. And, also we can set the default value with the return value of function. For example,
```
fun name(arg:String = anotherFun()) {
}
```
Here, the default value of the `arg` variable will be the value of `anotherFun`. Default parameters are eveluated at call time
- We can set default return value of a function. For example `fun getValue() = 20`, here whenever we call the `getValue` function we will get `20`.
- We can use `filter` to filter elements from list. For example, `list.filter {}`. Within `{}` we have to give filtering condition, like `it[0]=='p'`, this means if the first character of the element is equal to `p`. If we pass `true` boolean value within the `{}` then filter will return all the elements and if we pass `false` opposite will happen. `filter` will return a new list with filtered values.
- If we want lazy behaviour for any operation we can use `sequence`. Using sequence only one value will be taken at a time. We can use `.asSequence()` after a list to convert the list to sequenec and to convert a sequence to a list we can use `.toList()`. We can access element in the sequence using indexing. For example, to access the first element we have to do `seq.first()`.
- Lambda function does have any name and the function body is always within `{}`. Lambda function can have argument. We can assign lambda function to a variable.
```
var a = 20
val b = {c:Int -> c/2}
val b:(Int) -> Int = {c -> c/2} // this means b is any function which takes Int as argument and return Int
b(a)
```
We can pass lambda function as an argument to another function. For example,
```
fun parent(a:Int, b:(Int)->Int) : Int {
  return b(a)
}
```
To pass a normal function as an argument we use `::` with function name. For example `::functionName`. While passing lambda function as an arguemnt we can pass the variable name which holds the lambda function or we can directly pass the lambda function.
- Higher order function is a normal function which takes a function as an argument.
